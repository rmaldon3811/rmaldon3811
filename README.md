- 👋 Hi, I’m Rebecca! But you may know me as @rmaldon3811 on Github
- 👀 I’m interested in learning everything there is to know about software development.
- 🌱 I’m currently working to develop my skills with TripleTen!  So far, I have learned HTML/CSS, the beginning of JavaScript, how to use Figma, and VS Code. I am eager to grow my knowledge throughout the duration of my 10-month-long Triple Ten bootcamp.
- 💞️ I’m looking to create websites and develop mobile applications. I am excited to see where software development can take me in my future endeavors.
- 📫 You can reach me via email at rmaldon3811@yahoo.com. Or find me on social media on Instagram at my two handles- @Sunnydale89 or @Midmorningpoet
